# CST2110 Individual Programming Assignment #1

**Course**: BSc Computer Science  
**Module**: CST2110 – Programming  
**University**: Middlesex University  
**Deadline**: 10th January 2020  
**Language**: Java 8  
**IDE**: NetBeans 8  
**OS**: Windows

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository contains three independent Java projects, each solving a distinct programming task. The projects are organized as follows:


Each task is a cleaned NetBeans project and runs independently.

## 🧠 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Text Analysis

**Goal**: Analyze a Shakespeare play text file to determine:

- Total number of letters (case-insensitive)
- Frequency of each letter (sorted by most common)
- Output is printed to the console and saved to `results.txt`

**Key Concepts**: File I/O, Map Sorting, Exception Handling, Character Filtering

---

### 🎮 Task 2: Word Guessing Game

**Goal**: Create a console-based word guessing game.

- Random word selection from `wordlist.txt`
- Max 10 guesses, or user can give up with `*`
- Tracks incorrect guesses
- Displays final result and offers replay option

**Key Concepts**: Random Access, Game Logic, Input Validation, Loop Control

---

### 🔄 Task 3: Anagram Finder

**Goal**: Identify all valid single-word anagrams for a user-entered word/phrase using a 170,000+ word `lexicon.txt`.

- Ignores spaces and letter cases
- Lists all matching one-word anagrams
- Option to try again or exit

**Key Concepts**: Lexical Search, Sorting, String Normalization, Efficient Matching

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open each task separately as a NetBeans project.
2. Ensure required data files (`play.txt`, `wordlist.txt`, `lexicon.txt`) are placed in the root directory of the respective project.
3. Clean and build the project in NetBeans.
4. Run the `Main` class from each project.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Java 8
- NetBeans 8
- Windows OS (recommended for compatibility)

---

## 🛡️ Notes

- File paths are relative — **no hard-coded absolute paths**
- Each program includes proper exception handling
- Projects are "cleaned" for submission — no compiled `.class` files
- Designed with modularity and readability in mind
